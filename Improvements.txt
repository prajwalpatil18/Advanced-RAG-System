5️⃣ Evaluation Strategy Is Too Expensive

Running 5 LLM evals per query is:

❌ Too slow

❌ Too expensive

❌ Unstable

Enterprise pattern:

80% heuristic checks

20% sampled LLM eval

Async batch evaluation


🚀 How to Push This to 9/10 (Action Plan)
🔥 MUST DO

Wrap evals with hard isolation

Introduce LLMAdapter abstraction

Add retrieval confidence threshold

Move logs to structured async logging

🔥 SHOULD DO

Prompt versioning

Sampling-based eval

Add tracing IDs to frontend

🔥 OPTIONAL (10/10)

Canary prompt rollout

Automatic hallucination suppression

Feedback loop for retrieval tuning
